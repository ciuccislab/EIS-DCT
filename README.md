# EIS-DCT

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an experimental technique widely used in to analyze the working principles of batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors. While the measurement procedure is relatively easy, the analysis of the data collected remains difficult. The non-parametric distribution of relaxation times (DRT) has recently gained a broader acceptance due to its ability to separate electrochemical phenomena and compute physico-chemical parameters. However, the DRT is unsuitable to analyze the low-frequency part of the impedance when the imaginary component of the impedance diverges, as it is the case for systems characterized by blocking electrodes. To overcome this limitation, another distribution, namely the distribution of capacitive times (DCT), can be used for the admittance, i.e., the inverse of the impedance. In this article, we derive the theoretical framework of the DCT, highlight its advantages compared to the DRT, and propose a new method for deconvolving it from measured impedances.
